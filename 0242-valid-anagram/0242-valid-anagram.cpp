// we are given two strings s and t and needs to return true if it is an anagram of s and if not return false so , valid anagram means that both strings must havce same lengt5h andthey must contain same characters with same frequency. 
// 1. input strings are lowercase only ? 
// so here i can think of is a brute force solution to sort both strings and compare them i mean sort s and t and then if they become equal after sorting they are anagarms so , TC:- O(n log n) for each sort â†’ overall O(n log n)
// and sc :-   O(1) if sorting in-place

//.......optimized ...............
// we can improve this to O(n) time using hashmap or array to count character frequenceies. 
// if length differs return false and create a frequency count of each character in s , decrese the same count as we go through s , and if any count goes below zero -> not an anagram.  
// Tc :- o(n) and sc :- o(1)
